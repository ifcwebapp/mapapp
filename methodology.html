The size of the very small segment—based on the number of enterprises with less than 10 employees—is calculated using data from Brazil, India, Kenya and Mexico, as a percentage of the total. This is then used as an estimate for the rest of the countries.

Average revenues for the other segments (i.e., micro, very small, and medium, informal) are based on the regional averages from Enterprise Surveys as GDP per capita was not statistically significant in explaining the variation in revenues in these sectors.
